[These are quick and dirty instructions to give basic info on running
the RPC scripts. Primarily designed to help SoD come up to speed at
first. Thu Dec 19 12:55:18 PST 2013]

1) To get the most recent code, type "git pull origin master".

2) To get help from the Makefile on how to run scripts for testing, type "make
   help". (You will see this text as part of the output.)

3) To start the RPC server listening on a queue named with your login username
   (e.g., the account "logmatrix" would have a queue named "ipgrep-logmatrix"),
   type "make start".

   Do this in a separate window to watch the --verbose output.

   Do "tail -f rpc_anon_server.py.log" to watch the debug log file.

4) To run the client and have it anonymize a test file
   ("rwfind_201210011617_8428.txt"), type "make testa".
   
   The debugging output will be visible along with the client output.

5) To stop the server, use "make stop" or "make clean".  The "make clean" step
   will also delete all log files, temporary files, etc.
